# Login.gov Design Assets
A repository for the login.gov User Experience (UX) Team to publicly version, store and share assets from the program.

## About

The repository uses the P.A.R.A (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) method for organizing and cataloging our files. Any files added to this repository are part of a final approach to a particular cross functional design problem login.gov is aiming to solve.

### Projects

The Project folder contains each of the login.gov service buckets of work. Each folder contains a folder named for a specific JIRA ticket (e.g. LG-3009), with a goal and deadline associated with that ticket.

### Areas

This folder holds specific work related to either user experience or user research assets related to work being done on login.gov.

### Resources

The Resources folder contains specific assets related to login.gov branding and templates.

### Archives

The Archives folder contains inactive files that from Projects, Areas and Resources. This includes outdated branded assets and/or when a service bucket no longer is included in our offerings.
