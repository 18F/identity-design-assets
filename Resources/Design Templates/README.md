## Before you start: Install the fonts

1. Unzip the zipped packages in `fonts`.
2. Add all the unzipped files (`.ttf` and `.otf` files) to your system by dragging them into the **Font Book** application. If you have older versions of these fonts, you may want to diasable them in Font Book first.

## Before you start: Install the Sketch library

1. Clone or download this repo using the green `Clone or download` button in the top-right of the `identity-design-assets` repo. This will copy the repo files to your computer. If you downloaded the files, unzip the package and move the new files to an accessible spot on your computer.
2. Open Sketch > Preferences > Libraries
3. Select `Add Library...`
4. Find the repo folder `identity-design-assets`
5. Select the file `Component Library/identity-design-sketch.sketch`

Now, the identity sketch library is connected to your installation of Sketch, making their styles, symbols, and colors available.

:warning: **Don't directly edit these library files.** The identity sketch library is designed to keep your local files in sync with most current identity design tokens. Don't customize the library files â€” rather, use the shared library and styles to customize your project files.

### Updating the library
Occasionally, we'll make updates to the library. When it happens:

- A message will be sent to the login team in the ðŸ”’Slack #login-design channel
- The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/18F/identity-design-assets/blob/master/Component%20Library/CHANGELOG.md) will be updated. The CHANGELOG.md contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of the library. 

When you hear that there's a new release of our design assets, either pull that version from GitHub directly, or download the new assets with the provided link and replace the files manually. When you update the library files with a new library release, Sketch will notify you that there are library updates in any affected files, and you can review and accept those updates. This process keeps your local files in sync with the identity library.
