## Logo

Consistent and repeated use of the logo and lockups will establish equity and strengthen the visual identity of login.gov. To ensure consistency, it is critical that every person who uses the logo does so in accordance with the guidelines that follow, regardless of personal preference.

### The shield and wordmark

The login.gov logo is the cornerstone of our brand. Whenever possible, the red and blue version should be used. A white (or reverse) version can be used on a dark background.

### Whitespace

The logo should always be surrounded by generous white space. The diagram below defines the minimum amount of clear space needed, which is based on the cap-height of the typography.

### Minimum size

Establishing a minimum size ensures that the impact and legibility of the logo is not compromised in application:

- 104 pixels width
- 14 pixels height

## Logo usage

### Incorrect color usage

For optimum legibility and brand consistency, the logo should never be used in white with a light background. Conversely, the standard logo should never appear on a dark background.

### Do not modify the logo

- Do not outline
- Do not skew
- Do not apply effects
- Do not adjust spacing
- Do not drop shadows
- Do not distort
- Do not apply brand colors
- Do not apply gradients
- Do not rotate
- Do not mask images or graphics
- Do not use additional colors
- Do not not separate the shield from the wordmark in the primary / horizontal logo

## SVG Accessibility

To make SVGs useful for people using assistive technology devices such as screen readers, markup can be added by this type of pattern: `<svg> + role="img" + <title> + <desc> + aria-labelledby="[ID]"`. See Deque's Pattern 11 example: [Creating Accessible SVGs](https://www.deque.com/blog/creating-accessible-svgs/)
